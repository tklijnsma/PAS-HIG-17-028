\section{Conclusion}

A combination of differential cross sections for the differential observables $\pth$, $\njets$, $\absy$ and $\ptjet$ has been presented, using $35.9$\ifb of proton-proton collision data obtained at $\sqrt{s}=13$\TeV with the CMS detector.
% 
The spectra obtained are based on data from the $\hgg$, $\hzz$ and $\hbb$ decay channels.
% 
The overall uncertainty is decreased by 15\% relative to that for $\hgg$ alone by combining the $\pth$ spectra.
% 
The decrease is larger in the lower $\pth$ region than in the high $\pth$ tails.
% 
% An overall uncertainty decrease of uncertainty relative to $\hgg$ alone of about 15\% is realized with the combination of the $\pth$ spectrum, with a stronger improvement in the lower $\pth$ region than in the tails.
% 
No significant deviations from the SM are observed in any differential distribution.

The spectra obtained were interpreted in the Higgs coupling modifier framework, in which simultaneous variations of $\kappa_b$ and $\kappa_c$, $\kappa_t$ and $\kappa_g$ and $\kappa_t$ and $\kappa_b$ were fitted to the combination of the $\pth$-spectrum.
% 
The limits obtained on individual couplings were $\kappabLeftObserved < \kappa_b < \kappabRightObserved$ and $\kappacLeftObserved < \kappa_c < \kappacRightObserved$, assuming the branching fractions scale with the coupling modifiers.
% 
For the charm coupling $\kappa_c$ in particular, this measurement is competitive with those obtained from direct searches.
