%Author is always "The CMS Collaboration" for PAS and papers, so author, etc, below will be ignored in those cases
%For multiple affiliations, create an address entry for the combination

\author[cern]{The CMS Collaboration}

% The date is in yyyy/mm/dd format. Today has been

% For papers and PAS, \today is taken as the date the head file (this one) was last modified according to svn: see the RCS Id string above.
% For the final version it is best to "touch" the head file to make sure it has the latest date.

\abstract{Additional material: Simultaneous expected fit results for $\kappa_b$ and $\kappa_c$. One and two standard deviation contours are shown for the combined ($H \rightarrow \gamma\gamma$ and $H \rightarrow ZZ$) expectation, fixing the branching fractions to the values expected from the standard model. Also the corresponding one-dimensional scans of $\kappa_b$ and $\kappa_c$ are shown.}

% >> PDF Metadata
% Do not comment out the following hypersetup lines (metadata). They will disappear in NODRAFT mode and are needed by CDS.
% Also: make sure that the values of the metadata items are sensible and are in plain text:
% (1) no TeX! -- for \sqrt{s} use sqrt(s) -- this will show with extra quote marks in the draft version but is okay).
% (2) no %.
% (3) No curly braces {}.
